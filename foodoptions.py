breakfast = ["eggs and bacon, a protein filled way to start the day!",
             "something light, got any fresh fruit?",
             "a nice and easy bowl of cereal.",
             "go nuts! Waffles with lots of syrup!",
             "something simple. Toast or a bagel if you have it."]
lunch = ["PB&J, a classic dish! Or any type of sandwhich I suppose.",
         "some soup, to make you feel nice and cozy.",
         "a healthy salad. Takes a little work, but is always worth it!"]
