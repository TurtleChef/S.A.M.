# S.A.M.
A simple Python chat bot with a simple interface. Ask S.A.M. a question and S.A.M. will answer. Questions are very limited for now and a list of valid questions can be found below.

SAM starts by asking for your name, if your name is also Sam you'll get a special message :)

Questions that you can ask:
How old are you?
What is your name?
What is your favorite animal? (S.A.M. will ask you the same question back)
What is your favorite movie?
What is your favorite color? (S.A.M. will ask you the same question back)
What is your favorite food?
What day is it? / What is the date?
What time is it?
Where are you?

What should I have for breakfast? (Picks at random from a list of breakfast options) 
What should I have for lunch? (Picks at random from a list of lunch options)
Tell me a joke. (Picks at random from a list of jokes, currently there are 12 jokes)
Nothing else. / That is all. (Ends the questioning and S.A.M. says goodbye)
